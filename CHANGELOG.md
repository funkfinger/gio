# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and firmware in this repo follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Hardware uses `Rev N.M` notation, silkscreened on the PCB. See `docs/decisions.md` §13 for the full scheme.

**Convention:** this file is updated on every commit. Changes in-flight go under `## [Unreleased]`; on a firmware tag (`arp/vX.Y.Z`), those entries move under a new `## [arp/vX.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` heading.

Section keys: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`, `Docs`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Trigger ratcheting (Story 019).** New menu param `TRIG` (1, 2, 3, 4 — selectable via encoder). Each arp note still produces one pitch, but the gate fires N evenly-spaced times within the note. Each sub-gate is `(stepMs / N) * 0.5` long with a 5 ms floor. Composes with the external-clock multiplier — multiplier controls notes-per-pulse, ratchet controls gates-per-note (so external + ×2 + TRIG 3 = 6 gates per incoming pulse). Encoder cycle: SCALE → ORDER → ROOT → TRIG → SCALE. NeoPixel adds yellow/amber for TRIG. Bench-confirmed audibly at all four values. Future: random ratchet (Story 020 deferred).

- **Graphics pipeline for the OLED** — `assets/screens/*.png` are converted to a packed C++ bitmap library by `tools/bitmap2header.js` (Node, one dep: `pngjs`). The generated `firmware/arp/lib/screens/{screens.h,screens.cpp}` exposes each PNG as `screens::<name>` with a tiny `Screen` struct (`data`, `width`, `height`). **Animation support:** any subdirectory of PNGs under `assets/screens/` also emits a `screens::Animation` (ordered frame-pointer array + count). Frame order within a directory is natural-sort (`frame2` before `frame10`). Packed in Adafruit GFX `drawBitmap` byte order. Workflow: drop PNG → `npm run build:screens` → `pio run`. Details in `assets/screens/README.md`.
- **Boot splash animation.** 9-frame splash in `assets/screens/splash-screen-animation/` plays on every boot: frame 1 holds 3 s, frames 2–9 tick at 100 ms each (total ~3.8 s). Blocking call in `setup()`; runs before the normal menu renders.
- `OledUI::drawScreen(const screens::Screen&, x, y)` — thin passthrough to `Adafruit_SSD1306::drawBitmap()`.
- `OledUI::playAnimation(const screens::Animation&, first_frame_hold_ms, frame_delay_ms, x, y)` — blocking animation player with distinct first-frame hold (splash-friendly).
- `tools/generate-sample-png.js` — one-shot helper that creates a 32×64 test PNG for round-trip verification on fresh clones. Delete `assets/screens/sample.png` once real art exists.
- `package.json` at repo root — `npm install` pulls `pngjs`; `npm run build:screens` regenerates the library. Pivot from Python to Node for tooling since the project's primary human is more fluent in JS.

### Changed

- **Bitmap threshold flipped to OLED-native convention.** Previously: dark pixel in PNG → lit pixel on OLED. Now: **white pixel in PNG → lit pixel on OLED, black → off.** Matches how the panel physically looks — draw with light strokes on a black canvas and your image on screen matches the display. `tools/bitmap2header.js` updated; README and the sample-PNG generator follow suit.

- `firmware/arp/lib/trigger_in/` — pure-C++ firmware Schmitt trigger (`trigger_in::Schmitt`) for rising-edge detection on a polled voltage signal. Defaults to Eurorack-standard thresholds (high = +1.5 V, low = +0.5 V, 1 V hysteresis). Constructor accepts custom thresholds; initial state is "not armed" so an idle-high jack at startup doesn't fire spuriously. Story 016 prep — wires straight into the buffered ADC reads from Story 015 when bench-built.
- 15 new GoogleTest cases in `test_trigger_in/` covering: initial-state safety, rising-edge fire-once, square-wave repeat, exact-threshold behaviour, hysteresis (ripple rejection + must-drop-below-low to re-arm), slow-ramp single-fire, reset, custom thresholds. **Total host tests: 45 → 60, all green.**

### Changed

- **Renamed the chord-anchor menu param from ROOT to KEY.** "Key" better describes what the user is dialing in — the tonal centre that anchors both the chord intervals and the scale quantisation. The selected pitch class IS the chord's root AND the scale's tonic, and musicians ask "what key is this in?", not "what root is this in?". Touchpoints: `Param::Root` → `Param::Key`, `rootPC` → `keyPC`, `ROOT_OCTAVE_BASE_MIDI` → `KEY_OCTAVE_BASE_MIDI`, `"ROOT"` → `"KEY"` in OLED + serial. Asset directory `assets/screens/root-screen/` → `key-screen/`, PNGs `root-A.png`..`root-F.png` → `key-A.png`..`key-F.png`, `screens::root_*` → `screens::key_*`. Underlying pitch-class-to-string helper `rootName()` kept as-is (it's a generic pitch-class formatter, not specifically about "root"). Bench-flashed 2026-04-26.

- **SPI pin map confirmed against the actual arduino-pico variant header** for `seeed_xiao_rp2350`. Corrects mistakes in the earlier spec-doc draft. Final mapping: SCK=D8/GP2, MISO=D9/GP4, MOSI=D10/GP3, default SS=D3/GP5. CS_DAC=D3 (default SS), CS_ADC=D6/GP0. Encoder migrates from D8/D9/D10 to A1/A2/D7 to free SPI0 default pins.
- **Library decision for SPI peripherals locked: Rob Tillaart's `DAC8552` and `MCP_ADC`** — both Arduino-framework, MIT-licensed, well-maintained. User has bench-validated the DAC8552 library previously in `~/Git/Electronics/eurorack/dac8852-test/`. This means we don't roll our own SPI frame packers; instead `lib/outputs/` and `lib/inputs/` HAL wrappers add calibration math on top of the proven libraries. Lib_deps staged in `platformio.ini` (commented; uncomment when bench-ready).
- Story 012 updated with confirmed pin map, encoder migration table, library choice, and bench acceptance criteria. Status: prep complete, awaiting parts.

- **`docs/generative-arp-module.md` rewritten end-to-end** to reflect the platform-module pivot and the SPI signal-chain architecture. Net changes from prior revision:
  - Reframed as platform module hosting multiple apps; arp is now one app of several
  - PWM-DAC + MCP6002 + native ADC chain replaced by **DAC8552 + MCP3208 + TL072s on ±12V**
  - All 4 jacks documented as symmetric / dual-purpose (CV ↔ trigger/gate)
  - **Mutable Instruments–style protection** topology spec'd on every input and output (100k series + BAT43 clamps + op-amp buffer)
  - Pin-assignment table updated for SPI bus; encoder reassigned from D8/D9/D10 to A1/A2/D3 to free SPI0 default pin set
  - Generic panel labels (`IN 1`/`IN 2`/`OUT 1`/`OUT 2`/`KNOB`)
  - NeoPixel light-pipe through panel PCB documented as a Rev 0.1 feature
  - Firmware section grew an "Apps + Platform + HAL + Drivers" four-layer architecture diagram and `App` interface definition
  - BOM rebuilt against actual inventory locations
  - Removed all stale MCP4725 references and the GP29-on-XIAO-RP2350 myth
- `docs/decisions.md` — added §19 (platform-module reframing), §20 (SPI bus replaces PWM-DAC + native ADC), §21 (TL072 + ±12V replaces MCP6002 + 5V), §22 (Mutable-style protection on every jack), §23 (generic jack labels). Reorganised "Deferred decisions" to separate **resolved** items (CV divider, ext-clock divider feel, gio-as-clock-source) from **still-open** items (calibration storage, app-private settings, second pot for Rev 0.2, NeoPixel light-pipe style, DAC VREF source, trigger output edge speed). Added a note to §18 (RP2350-E9) clarifying that the platform pivot moves CV/trigger jacks behind op-amp buffers, so the rule's practical impact on Rev 0.1 is small.
- `docs/stories/011-power-rails.md` reduced from "build a power supply" to "verify the Hivemind Protomato breadboarding kit's rails" — the bench platform handles ±12V/+5V/GND with reverse-protection. Original LM7805 + 1N5818 design preserved as reference for the Rev 0.1 PCB.

### Docs

- **Platform-module pivot scoped.** Stories 011–018 added — full bench-rebuild roadmap moving the design from "single-purpose arpeggiator on native ADC + PWM-DAC" to "platform module with shared SPI bus (DAC8552 + MCP3208) + MI-style protection + TL072 buffers + app-loader firmware skeleton."
- **Inventory check complete** (against `~/Git/binkey-data/parts/`). On hand and sufficient for bench: TL072CP (×25), DAC8552 (×4 — *upgrade* from spec'd MCP4822), PEC11L encoders (×5), PJ-3001F Thonkiconn jacks (30+), 100 kΩ linear pots (20+), BAT43 Schottky (50+), LM7805 + LM7912, all standard SMT R/C values. **Ordered:** MCP3208 SPI ADC (×2), Eurorack 2×5 shrouded headers (×5), 0.49" 64×32 SSD1306 OLED (delivery tomorrow). DAC8552 already mounted on a hand-soldered protoboard, ready for Story 012 SPI bring-up.

## [arp/v0.3.0] — 2026-04-23

**External clock-in lands; bench tooling matures.** Story 010 complete. gio can now be patched into an external Eurorack clock and follow it; the tempo pot becomes a clock multiplier (×1 / ×2 / ×4) when external is active. A standalone bench clock source (`firmware/clock-mod2/`) was built on a HAGIWO MOD2 board to drive testing. Two notable hardware bugs encountered and documented: RP2350-E9 silicon errata (broken internal pulldowns) and a MOD2 PCB defect (JP2 doesn't route to C18). 45 host tests still green.

### Added

- **Story 010:** External clock input on J1 (D3 / GP5). `digitalRead`-based edge detection with 10 ms software debounce (rejects bounce on slow edges). Auto-switches to external mode within 2 s of a detected rising edge; falls back to internal tempo pot on timeout. OLED top-right tag shows `INT` / `EXT`.
- **Story 010:** Tempo pot acts as a **clock multiplier** when external is active — bottom 1/3 = ×1 (one step per pulse), middle = ×2 (insert one interpolated step at half-period), top = ×4 (three interpolated steps at quarter-period spacing). Default ×2 chosen as the most musically useful at typical Eurorack clock rates. Interpolation uses the previously-measured period — one-pulse-late approximation; see `decisions.md` deferred section for the runaway-on-slowdown caveat.
- `firmware/clock-mod2/` — bench clock source for a HAGIWO MOD2 board (XIAO RP2350 socketed). POT1 sets pulse rate exponentially in **2..20 Hz** (renamed from BPM since "BPM" is the wrong unit for a raw clock). GP1 → MOD2 op-amp gain stage → 0–10 V gates at J6. GP5 drives the panel LED in sync.
- `docs/stories/010-clock-input.md`, detailed `docs/bench-log.md` entry covering the full Story 010 + side-quest bench journey.

### Changed

- `firmware/arp/src/main.cpp`: `PIN_J1 = D3 / GP5` (digital, not analog). Spec called for `A3 / GP29` but **GP29 is not exposed on the XIAO RP2350** (variant only breaks out GP0–7 + GP9–12, GP16–17, GP20–21). All ADC-capable pins (GP26/27/28) are already used, so J1 is digital-only on this build; pitch mode on J1 is deferred until an ADC channel is freed.
- `firmware/arp/src/main.cpp`: `pinMode(PIN_J1, INPUT_PULLDOWN)` — kept as belt-and-braces, but the internal pulldown is silently broken on RP2350 (see RP2350-E9 below). The external 10 kΩ pulldown is what actually pulls the pin low.
- Bench input divider on J1: spec was 100 kΩ + 68 kΩ; **bench-built as 10 kΩ + 10 kΩ** to overpower the RP2350-E9 latched-pad voltage. Same 1:2 ratio so firmware needs no change.
- `firmware/clock-mod2/`: switched from `tempo::potToBpm` (20..300 BPM, quarter notes) to direct exponential `potToHz` (2..20 Hz). "BPM" is the wrong unit for a raw clock source; raised the floor and ceiling to better match Eurorack clock rates.

### Docs

- **`docs/decisions.md` §18 — RP2350-E9 silicon errata.** Internal `INPUT_PULLDOWN` latches the pad at ~2.2 V instead of pulling to GND. Pi Foundation workaround: external pulldown ≤ 8.2 kΩ. Cost ~90 min of bench debugging during Story 010 before user spotted the errata. **Rule for Rev 0.1 PCB:** every GPIO that needs a pulldown gets an external resistor ≤ 8.2 kΩ.
- `docs/decisions.md` "Deferred decisions" — added: (a) the MOD2 JP2 lesson (verify every solder-jumper net survives schematic→PCB transfer); (b) "gio as a clock source" feature placeholder; (c) external-clock multiplier feel notes (×1/×2/×4 is fine; replace with ÷N would be a regression at Eurorack rates; multiplication is the genuinely useful direction).
- **BOOTSEL workflow update** — discovered today that `picotool` can soft-reset the running firmware into BOOTSEL via USB CDC, so `pio run --target upload` works without any button-press for normal re-flashes. Manual hold-BOOT-while-plug only needed for fresh chips or unresponsive firmware. Updated `CLAUDE.md`, `firmware/arp/README.md`, and `firmware/clock-mod2/README.md`.
- `firmware/clock-mod2/README.md`: documents the **JP2/C18 board defect on MOD2 Rev A** — soldered solder-bridge has no electrical effect because the JP2 traces don't reach C18. Workaround: solder a wire across C18 directly.
- New `docs/stories/010-clock-input.md`.

## [arp/v0.2.0] — 2026-04-22

**Module is fully hands-on playable.** Stories 006–009 complete. Live tempo pot, OLED + encoder hardware alive, full encoder menu (scale + order + root with long-press reset), audible scale quantisation per step, and V/oct CV input on J2 that transposes the arp. 45 host tests passing.

### Added

- **Story 009:** `firmware/arp/lib/cv/` — pure-C++ `cvVoltsToTranspose(volts, scale)` (semitone round → scale-snap within octave, input clamped to [0, 8 V]). 10 new host tests.
- **Story 009:** CV input on J2 transposes the arp (V/oct, α-summed with encoder ROOT). ½-semitone hysteresis wrapper kills ADC-noise flutter at snap boundaries. Final played notes clamped to MIDI [24, 96].
- **Story 009:** MCP6002 op-amp B repurposed as unity-gain buffer on the CV input path. Divider: 100 kΩ series + (47 kΩ + 22 kΩ) to GND = 69 kΩ (≈ spec 68 kΩ). Maps 0..8 V at J2 to 0..3.24 V at A1/GP27.
- **Story 009:** New menu param `ROOT` (12 pitch classes, pinned to MIDI octave 3, default C). Encoder menu cycle: SCALE → ORDER → ROOT → SCALE. NeoPixel **magenta** for ROOT active. OLED `ROOT` line shows the *effective* root (encoder + CV, mod 12) with trailing `*` when CV is contributing.
- **Story 009:** Chord stored as intervals `{0, 4, 7, 12}` instead of absolute MIDI notes. Runtime `root_midi` computed per step.
- **Story 008:** Encoder menu for Scale and Order. Click cycles parameter (Scale → Order → Scale), rotate changes the active value, **long-press (≥500 ms)** resets the arp at step 0 and flashes "RESET" on the OLED. Long-press fires mid-hold; release is silent (no spurious short-click on the same gesture).
- **Story 008:** Scale changes are now *audible* — each arp note passes through `quantize()` with the active scale before reaching the DAC.
- **Story 008:** Onboard RGB LED as active-param indicator — green for Scale, blue for Order. Pin discovery: data on **GPIO22**, power-enable on **GPIO23** (per Seeed wiki; not exposed by the arduino-pico variant header). LED is **RGBW** (4 bytes/pixel) → `NEO_GRBW + NEO_KHZ800`. 20 ms settle delay between power-enable and first `show()`.
- **Story 007:** `firmware/arp/lib/oled_ui/` — HAL wrapper around `Adafruit_SSD1306`. Three-constant config block (`OLED_WIDTH`, `OLED_HEIGHT`, `OLED_ROTATION`) for one-line swap between bench (0.91" 128×32 landscape) and final (0.49" 64×32 portrait).
- **Story 007:** `firmware/arp/lib/encoder_input/` — HAL wrapper around `mathertel/RotaryEncoder` + 50 ms-debounced click + `pressedLong()` (≥500 ms threshold). `LatchMode = FOUR3` chosen after bench iteration.
- **Story 006:** Tempo pot on A0 (D0/GP26, B10K) drives live BPM control. `src/main.cpp` reads `analogRead(PIN_TEMPO)` at every step boundary and recomputes step/gate periods from `tempo::potToBpm()` + `tempo::bpmToStepMs(bpm, 4)`. Subdivision switched from quarter notes to 16th notes (125 ms/step at 120 BPM).
- Host test coverage grew from 34 → 45: new `test_tempo::PotToBpm.ConstantRatioPerEqualPotSlice`, 11 `test_arp` cases kept current after `Order1324 → Skip` rename, 10 new `test_cv` cases.
- `docs/decisions.md` §17: encoder library choice documented (`mathertel/RotaryEncoder`, polling, RP2350-compatible). Deferred-decisions bullet removed.
- `firmware/arp/README.md`: documented the BOOTSEL quirk (double-tap BOOT unreliable on our XIAO RP2350; use hold-BOOT-while-plugging).
- `docs/stories/009-cv-input-transpose.md` added. `docs/bench-log.md` entries for Stories 006, 007, 008, 009 (including the 100 Ω vs 100 kΩ colour-band bug and its diagnosis from serial output).

### Changed

- `lib/arp/ArpOrder::Order1324` → `ArpOrder::Skip` (matches menu UI labeling). Test cases renamed. No behaviour change.
- `lib/tempo/potToBpm()` mapping: linear → exponential (`BPM_MIN × (BPM_MAX/BPM_MIN)^pot`). Endpoints exact; ratio per equal pot slice is constant → uniform musical feel across rotation.
- `lib/tempo/BPM_MIN`: 30 → 40 (Story 006 spec) → **20** (bench-feel adjustment — 40 BPM 16ths still felt too fast at the slow end). Per-third ratio ≈ 2.47×.
- `firmware/arp/src/main.cpp` rewritten three times across Stories 006–009: tempo-pot integration → standalone OLED/encoder bring-up → full arp+menu integration → CV-transpose integration. Now a non-blocking `millis()` loop with all subsystems live.
- `lib/encoder_input/` `RotaryEncoder::LatchMode` bench-tuned to `FOUR3` (TWO03 → FOUR0 → FOUR3 during Story 008 bring-up; header documents troubleshooting hints).
- `docs/stories/006-tempo-pot.md`: AC text updated to reflect the 20..300 BPM range and constant-ratio framing (replaces "every 1/3 doubles BPM" language).
- `firmware/arp/README.md`: library notes corrected (was: Stoffregen Encoder, default OLED size; now: mathertel/RotaryEncoder, `oled_ui` config block, NeoPixel pinout).
- `firmware/arp/platformio.ini`: added `mathertel/RotaryEncoder` to `lib_deps`; removed `paulstoffregen/Encoder` (AVR-only).

## [arp/v0.1.0] — 2026-04-22

**Milestone: the module makes music.** Stories 001–005 complete. End-to-end signal chain bench-validated: scales/arp/tempo logic + 12-bit PWM DAC on D2 + 2-pole RC filter + MCP6002 op-amp scaling + BC548 NPN gate driver + LED beat indicator. Audible 4-note up-arpeggio at 120 BPM through a VCO confirmed on bench. 34 host tests passing.

### Added

- **Story 005:** `firmware/arp/lib/arp/` — pure-C++ arpeggiator engine. `Arp::nextNote()` advances state and returns the MIDI note for the current step. Orders implemented: `Up`, `Down`, `UpDown` (palindrome, no endpoint repeat), `Order1324` (skip pattern, falls back to `Up` for arps with <4 notes). Adding a new order = adding one case in `indexForStep()`.
- **Story 005:** `firmware/arp/lib/tempo/` — pure-C++ tempo helper. `bpmToStepMs(bpm, sub=1)` clamped to [30, 300] BPM with subdivision support; `potToBpm(pot)` linear in [0, 1] → [BPM_MIN, BPM_MAX].
- **Story 005:** 21 new GoogleTest cases (`test_arp` ×11, `test_tempo` ×10). Combined with `test_scales` (×13): 34 host tests, all green via `pio test -e native`.
- **Story 005:** `src/main.cpp` arp integration — non-blocking `millis()` loop, fixed 120 BPM, 4-note up-arpeggio over MIDI 48/52/55/60 (C3 E3 G3 C4), 50 % gate duty, `PIN_LED` as beat indicator. `GATE_INVERTED` constant abstracts NPN driver polarity.
- **Story 005:** BC548 NPN common-emitter gate driver wired on breadboard — D6 → 1 kΩ → base; collector → 10 kΩ pullup → 5V (= J4 gate node); emitter → GND.
- **Story 004:** MCP6002 op-amp non-inverting amp breadboarded (gain network 2.2 kΩ + 470 Ω in series for R_f, 10 kΩ for R_g), bench-calibrated 2026-04-22. Final firmware `GAIN = 1.26`. V/Oct output within ±2 mV / ±2.4¢ across C3–C7 by multimeter; ≤±4¢ best-fit residual end-to-end through VCO + tuner.
- **Story 003:** `firmware/arp/lib/scales/` — pure-C++ scale quantiser library: `quantize(midiNote, Scale)` and `scaleFromPot(pot, current)` with ±2 % hysteresis. No Arduino deps. 13 GoogleTest cases (in-scale pass-through, out-of-scale snapping with tie-break-downward, chromatic identity, octave invariance, scaleFromPot zone centres + hysteresis).
- **Story 003:** PWM DAC ramp bench-verified — raw 36.6 kHz square, 1-pole sawtooth, 2-pole clean ramp.
- **Story 002:** XIAO RP2350 blinky flashed via UF2 (picotool). Toolchain end-to-end verified.
- **Story 001:** Repo scaffolded — `firmware/arp/`, `hardware/`, `docs/`, `docs/stories/` directory tree; `LICENSE-firmware` (MIT), `LICENSE-hardware` (Apache 2.0), `LICENSE-docs` (CC-BY 4.0); root `README.md`; `CLAUDE.md`; `.gitignore`; `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; `firmware/arp/platformio.ini` and `firmware/arp/README.md`.
- New file `docs/calibration.md` — circuit, procedure, and raw data for the V/Oct stage.
- `docs/bench-log.md` started — entries for Stories 003, 004, 005.

### Changed

- **DAC architecture:** replaced MCP4725 I2C DAC with RP2350 12-bit hardware PWM on D2 + 2-pole RC filter (2× 10 kΩ + 100 nF, f_c ≈ 160 Hz). Eliminates I2C bus contention, removes MCP4725 from BOM, simplifies firmware (no library needed). Ripple < 63 µV; settling time ~5 ms. D2 pin reassigned from CV In #2 to PWM V/Oct out.
- **Input jacks:** J1 moved from D7 (digital-only, GP1) to A3 (GP29, ADC-capable). Both jacks dual-purpose: CLOCK mode (rising-edge) or PITCH mode (V/Oct → quantise), selectable per jack in encoder menu. Identical protection circuits (100 kΩ series + 68 kΩ to GND + BAT54 dual Schottky), 0–8V V/Oct → 0–3.24V ADC. D7 (GP1) freed as spare digital GPIO.
- **Timing architecture:** `millis()` state machine (non-blocking) chosen over `delay()` for gate/step timing. Allows encoder, OLED, pot, and external clock to be serviced every loop iteration. Hardware timer (Path B) deferred unless bench reveals audible jitter.
- `firmware/arp/platformio.ini`: `platform =` set to `maxgerhardt/platform-raspberrypi` with `platform_packages = framework-arduinopico @ …#4.4.0`. The bare `earlephilhower/arduino-pico` git URL cannot be used as `platform =` directly because PlatformIO requires a `platform.json` manifest at the package root.
- `firmware/arp/platformio.ini`: removed `paulstoffregen/Encoder` from `lib_deps` — uses AVR-specific register macros (`DIRECT_PIN_READ`, `pin1_register`) that do not compile on RP2350. Will be replaced with an RP2350-compatible alternative in Story 007.
- `firmware/arp/src/main.cpp`: `LED_BUILTIN` → `PIN_LED` — the `seeed_xiao_rp2350` variant defines `PIN_LED (25u)` but does not alias `LED_BUILTIN`.
- `docs/decisions.md` §11 corrected: arduino-pico has no per-pin `analogWriteFreq(pin, freq)` overload in any released version (only global form exists). Decision updated: use global `analogWriteFreq(freq)` once in `setup()`; for future multi-slice PWM use pico-sdk directly.
- `docs/decisions.md`: renumbered the duplicate §9/§10 entries (OLED and Git workflow); §11 is now "Platform version pinned to a tagged release"; subsequent sections shift to §12–§16.
- Stale `MCP4725` references removed from `docs/decisions.md` and `docs/stories/004` and `005`.
